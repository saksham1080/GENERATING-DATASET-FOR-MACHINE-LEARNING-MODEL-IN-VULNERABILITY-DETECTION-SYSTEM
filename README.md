# Analyzing Brain Signals to Detect Various Emotions and Identify Depression  

## Introduction  
This project explores the use of EEG (Electroencephalogram) brain signals to classify human emotions and eventually identify signs of depression. By leveraging signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, this work aims to contribute to the field of mental health analysis through innovative computational approaches.  

## Objectives  
- Analyze EEG brain signal data to detect and classify emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear.  
- Build a robust system capable of processing brain signals using feature extraction and classification techniques.  
- Extend the framework to detect depression as a future enhancement.  

## Features  
- **Emotion Detection**: Identify emotional states based on EEG signals.  
- **Machine Learning**: Use advanced algorithms like neural networks for classification.  
- **Signal Processing**: Implement techniques like time-frequency analysis and feature extraction to analyze EEG data.  
- **Future Scope**: Extend functionality to include depression detection for mental health insights.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Signal Processing Tools**: PyEEG, MNE  
- **Machine Learning Models**: SVM, Decision Trees, Neural Networks  

## Dataset  
The project uses publicly available EEG datasets such as:  
1. **DEAP Dataset**: A dataset for emotion analysis using EEG, physiological, and video signals.  
2. **SEED Dataset**: A dataset for emotion classification using EEG signals.
